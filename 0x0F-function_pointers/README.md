File: 0-print_name.c -Write a function that prints a name. Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));

File: 1-array_iterator.c -Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int)); . where size is the size of the array. and action is a pointer to the function you need to use

File: 2-int_index.c -Write a function that searches for an integer. Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int)); where size is the number of elements in the array array. cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values. int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0. If no element matches, return -1. If size <= 0, return -1

3-op_functions.c -This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):
op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b); op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b); op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b); op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b); op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);
